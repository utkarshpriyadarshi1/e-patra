## Local Development Standards

### Code Style Guidelines
* **Backend (Java):** Follow standard Spring Boot and Oracle Java conventions. Use clear, descriptive class/method names and Javadoc comments for API surfaces.
* **Frontend (React + JavaScript):** Use modern functional components, standard React Hooks, and clean CSS styling. Write declarative, self-documenting code.
* **Documentation:** Keep documentation, comments, and logs updated to match your changes.

### Git Commit Conventions
We recommend clear commit messages to help maintain clean history:
* Use the imperative mood (e.g., `add packaging builder`, `fix duplicate file upload`).
* Reference issues in the commit message or PR description (e.g., `Closes #12`).
